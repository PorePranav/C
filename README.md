#C 
All of my c code yet, while I was learning C, need to update with more code, also includes a library "pranav.h" with some useful algorithms.
Better not use it with proprietary software God is watching you ðŸ˜’ ðŸ˜’ , I know this isn't much of code, but I dont want any of it been used in proprietary software!!
